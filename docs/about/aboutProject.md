There is hardly any area of life that is not affected by electrical products - be it smart phones, smart homes (the housing of the future) or smart grids (intelligent power grids).

In the BSc Electrical and Information Technology program, value is placed on a sound basic knowledge, which is supplemented by laboratory experiments. At the same time, teams work on interdisciplinary, practice-oriented student projects covering the entire range from microelectronics (e.g. configurable, digital effect devices for guitarists playing electric guitar) to electrical engineering (e.g. power generation with kites).

## :mortar_board: Bachelor Thesis

The Bachelor Thesis is decisive for the transition into professional life. Depending on the problem, the project contains aspects from the fields of hardware or software development, simulation or calculation. The following contents are implemented and evaluated.

Contents:
* Familiarization with the topic
* Preparation of the project clarification including specification sheet and project plan
* Implementation phase (technical work, where engineering and result-oriented approach should be demonstrated)
* Project management (implementation of milestones, communication with the customer and the supervisor, project controlling)
* Documentation of the project results (report, poster and website)
* Poster exhibition and defence


::: tip Preliminary Project for Bachelor Thesis
The project description on this website includes the preliminary project for the Bachelor Thesis. This preliminary project is carried out during half a year and serves as a proof of concept. With this preliminary study the feasibility of the Bachelor Thesis should be checked and some knowledge should be acquired.
