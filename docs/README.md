features:
- title: Direction Finding Using Angle of Arrival
  details: In the angle of arrival (AoA) method, the device to which direction is being determined, such as a tag in an RTLS solution, transmits a special direction finding signal using a single antenna. The receiving device, such as a locator in that same RTLS solution, has multiple antennae arranged in an array. As the transmitted signal crosses the array, the receiving device sees a signal phase difference due to the difference in distance from each of the antenna in its array to the transmitting antenna.
- title: Built on Top of new Bluetooth 5.1 Stack
  details: In version 5.1 of the Bluetooth Core Specification, Bluetooth added an optional direction finding capability. Using this new feature, a Bluetooth device can determine the direction of a signal being transmitted from another Bluetooth device. This seemingly basic capability has the potential to significantly enhance Bluetooth location services solutions.
- title: Built with Supported Hardware
  details: The hardware consists of the AoA development kit from Texas Instruments. This is the first freely available develompent kit for bluetooth positioning systems with the new bluetooth 5.1 standard (as of february 2020). The entire test setup is based on ready-made modules, no self-designed hardware is necessary.
