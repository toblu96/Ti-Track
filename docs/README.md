features:
- title: Direction Finding Using Angle of Arrival
  details: In the angle of arrival (AoA) method, the device to which direction is being determined, such as a tag in an RTLS solution, transmits a special direction finding signal using a single antenna. The receiving device, such as a locator in that same RTLS solution, has multiple antennae arranged in an array. As the transmitted signal crosses the array, the receiving device sees a signal phase difference due to the difference in distance from each of the antenna in its array to the transmitting antenna.
- title: Built on Top of new Bluetooth 5.1 Stack
  details: In version 5.1 of the Bluetooth Core Specification, Bluetooth added an optional direction finding capability. Using this new feature, a Bluetooth device can determine the direction of a signal being transmitted from another Bluetooth device. This seemingly basic capability has the potential to significantly enhance Bluetooth location services solutions.
- title: Pre-project for the Bachelor Thesis at the FHNW in Switzerland
  details: The goal of the bachelor thesis starting in August 2020 is to develop a system that can track the position of multiple devices using Bluetooth AoA. Since this technology based on the Bluetooth Core Stack is still in development, this preliminary project serves as a proof of concept for the Bachelor Thesis. Until August 2020 the principle of Bluetooth AoA will be learned with the already existing hardware components and the strengths and weaknesses will be determined. More about this project can be found in the About section.
